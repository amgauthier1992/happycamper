# Happy Camper

An application designed to help those that are living and traveling on the move. Users can search for a list of National Parks and affiliated campgrounds in their state to see which locations are suitable for RVs/trailers and other mobile campers.

## Motivation

My wife and I have talked about living in a tiny home on wheels for almost a year now. I wanted to attempt the creation of a centralized resource that would give us (and others) information about places where we could park or stay if we ever were to have a mobile tiny home and/or RV setup.
